# Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New n8n Trigger Node (`HannaBotTrigger`)
- **Location**: `n8n-nodes-hanna/nodes/HannaBotTrigger/HannaBotTrigger.node.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Webhook-based trigger that receives IRC events
  - Authentication token validation
  - Event type filtering (mention, privmsg, join, part, quit, kick, mode, nick, topic, notice)
  - Optional channel and user filtering
  - Option to include/exclude bot's own messages

### 2. Enhanced IRC Bot with Trigger System
- **Location**: `main.go`
- **New Features**:
  - Flexible trigger configuration via `TRIGGER_CONFIG` environment variable
  - Support for multiple trigger endpoints
  - Event-based architecture for various IRC events
  - Backward compatibility with existing `N8N_WEBHOOK` configuration

### 3. New Event Types Supported
- `mention` - When the bot is mentioned in a message
- `privmsg` - All private messages (including channel messages)
- `notice` - IRC notices received
- `join` - When someone joins a channel
- `part` - When someone leaves a channel
- `quit` - When someone quits the IRC server
- `kick` - When someone is kicked from a channel
- `mode` - Channel or user mode changes
- `nick` - When someone changes their nickname
- `topic` - When channel topic is changed

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure the IRC Bot

Set the `TRIGGER_CONFIG` environment variable with your n8n webhook URLs and tokens:

```bash
export TRIGGER_CONFIG='{
  "endpoints": {
    "mentions": {
      "url": "https://your-n8n.example.com/webhook/hanna-mentions",
      "token": "your-secret-token-123",
      "events": ["mention"]
    },
    "all-events": {
      "url": "https://your-n8n.example.com/webhook/hanna-all",
      "token": "another-secret-token",
      "events": ["privmsg", "join", "part", "quit", "kick", "mode", "topic", "notice", "nick"],
      "channels": ["#general", "#support"]
    }
  }
}'
```

### Step 2: Set Up n8n Trigger Nodes

1. In your n8n workflow, add a "Hanna Bot Trigger" node
2. Configure the authentication token (must match the token in TRIGGER_CONFIG)
3. Select which IRC events you want to monitor
4. Optionally filter by channels or users
5. Copy the webhook URL from the node
6. Add this URL to your TRIGGER_CONFIG

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Start the IRC bot with the new configuration
2. Trigger some IRC events (join a channel, mention the bot, etc.)
3. Check your n8n workflow execution logs

## Example Workflows

### Simple Bot Mention Handler
```json
{
  "trigger": "Hanna Bot Trigger",
  "config": {
    "authToken": "secret-123",
    "events": ["mention"],
    "channelFilter": "#support,#general"
  },
  "actions": [
    "OpenAI Chat Completion",
    "Hanna Bot Send Message"
  ]
}
```

### Channel Moderation Monitor
```json
{
  "trigger": "Hanna Bot Trigger", 
  "config": {
    "authToken": "mod-token",
    "events": ["kick", "mode", "join", "part"],
    "channelFilter": "#general"
  },
  "actions": [
    "Log to Database",
    "Send Alert if Needed"
  ]
}
```

## Migration from Legacy Setup

If you were using `N8N_WEBHOOK`, the bot will automatically create a legacy endpoint for backward compatibility that listens for "mention" events only.

**Old way:**
```bash
N8N_WEBHOOK=https://n8n.example.com/webhook/abc123
```

**New way (recommended):**
```bash
TRIGGER_CONFIG='{"endpoints": {"legacy": {"url": "https://n8n.example.com/webhook/abc123", "events": ["mention"]}}}'
```

## Payload Structure

Each trigger receives this data structure:

```json
{
  "eventType": "mention",
  "sender": "username", 
  "target": "#channel",
  "message": "Hello @botname how are you?",
  "chatInput": "Hello @botname how are you?",
  "botNick": "botname",
  "sessionId": "IRC",
  "timestamp": 1693526400,
  "messageTags": {
    "time": "2023-09-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated IRC bot with trigger configuration
2. Install the updated n8n node package in your n8n instance
3. Create workflows using the new trigger node
4. Test with various IRC events

The system is now much more flexible and allows you to create sophisticated IRC bot workflows that react to various events beyond just mentions!
